## Swin-SpindleNet - Spindle detection model
- This module is built upon the research presented in the paper titled "[Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030)". We sincerely thank the authors and contributors of the Swin Transformer project for their groundbreaking work in developing this general vision transformer model. Their dedication and research have significantly advanced the field.
- In this study, a novel spindle detection approach integrating the advantages of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) in signal visualization with the strengths of Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (Swin Transformer) in image classification, i.e., Swin-Wavelet, was presented. The innovations of the paper mainly include three aspects: 1) It is the first attempt at applying general vision transformer to spindle detection across multi-scale public spindle datasets, laying the foundation for simultaneous analysis of EEG and fMRI. 2) The end-to-end framework shows high detection accuracy and reliable generalization both on large-sample dataset (MASS) and small-sample dataset (DREAMS), while realizing flexible coordinate prediction of sleep spindles with stable intersection over union (IoU). 3) This work explores and confirms that a relatively robust recognition performance can be achieved by utilizing image-level (two-dimensional) information, thus providing new insights for the processing of one-dimensional sleep spindle signals. 
- The implemented code is based on GitHub at [WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing](https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing/tree/master/pytorch_classification/swin_transformer). We have adapted and expanded upon it to meet the specific requirements of our implementation.
