## Large segmentation model for MRI imaging
- This module is built upon the research presented in the paper titled "[Segment anything in medical images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z)". We would like to sincerely thank the authors and contributors of the MedSAM project for their exceptional work in developing this innovative medical image segmentation model. Their dedication and research have significantly advanced the field, and their code has played a crucial role in the success and functionality of our project.
- The implemented code is based on GitHub at [bowang-lab/MedSAM](https://github.com/bowang-lab/MedSAM).
- We have adapted and expanded upon it to meet the specific requirements of our implementation, and the extension code is in the folder - "rectal_cancer_expansion".
